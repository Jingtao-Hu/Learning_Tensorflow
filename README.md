# Learning_Tensorflow
This repository will contain basic Tensorflow tutorials and deep learning concepts. It'll also contain some experiments on some papers that I read and some interesting model that I find on Internet or books. Hopefully, the repository will be helpful to everyone reading!
Basic contains basic Tensorflow tutorials, such as graph, session, tensor, nerual networks, CNN, etc.[a link](https://github.com/Quan-Sun/Learning_Tensorflow/tree/master/Basic)
