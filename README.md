# Learning_Tensorflow
This repository will contain basic Tensorflow tutorials and deep learning concepts. It'll also contain some experiments on some papers that I read and some interesting model that I find on Internet or books. Hopefully, the repository will be helpful to everyone reading!   
**[Basic](https://github.com/Quan-Sun/Learning_Tensorflow/tree/master/Basic)** contains basic Tensorflow tutorials, such as graph, session, tensor, nerual networks, CNN, etc.   
**[CNNs with Noisy Labels](https://github.com/Quan-Sun/Learning_Tensorflow/blob/master/CNNs%20with%20Nosiy%20Labels.ipynb)** a interesting experiment that I found on Github, which tests how convolutional neural networks that are trained on random labels (with some probability) are still able to acheive good accuracy on MNIST. However, my result shows a different conclusion that the random labels can surely affect the CNNs' performance.
